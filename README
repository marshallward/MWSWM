MWSWM: Marshall Ward's Shallow Water Model
==========================================

This was the shallow water model used to generate the numerical results from my
doctoral dissertation.

It's mostly just a pseudospectral model of f-plane dynamics on a square
periodic domain, prepped with various initial conditions (generated by the
other program).

It's not well organised and probably not good for much anymore.  I'm just
chucking it here so that I don't lose it.

Also includes some Matlab scripts to analyse the spectral modes of the flow (I
think...).
